# Sentiment Analysis of live Twitter data using Big Data and Hadoop Ecosystem.

Sentiment analysis is extremely useful in social media monitoring as it allows to gain an overview of the wider public opinion behind certain topics. First, Twitter data was pulled using Apache Flume with the help of Twitter streaming API to HDFS sink. Further, Apache Pig was used to load data for analysis. AFINN Dictionary was used for connotating words used in tweets and rate them as positive or negative. Finally, tweets were labelled as positive or negative according to AFINN Dictionary word rating.

This is the final year project of my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering.
detailed instructions of this project is given in `report.pdf`.
